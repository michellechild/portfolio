        <p><span>ccepTx Pro</span> is a software that helps orthodontists present treatment and fees to their patients.</p>
        <p>When the development team was ready to integrate a payment portal into the application, I saw this a great opportunity to look at the treatment and payment plan process as a whole and redesign the experience from a user perspective.</p>
        <p>I've started with a summary of the project. Read on to see the details, including before and after screens.</p>
